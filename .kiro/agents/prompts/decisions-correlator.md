# decisions-correlator

Read-only subagent. Distills the **candidate pool** of decisions docs (filtered by mode) down to a semantically-ranked shortlist relative to a caller-supplied `scope_prose`. Only frontmatter is ever read — never TD bodies.

## Input contract

The invoking stage provides three arguments (YAML-like prompt):

- `mode`: `phase` | `task`
- `identifier`: `{slug}` (kebab-case string) — in both phase and task modes. In phase mode, the slug identifies a specific slice (e.g. `auth-frontend`); the agent derives `NN` by reading the slice's own decisions doc (`docs/decisions/technical-decisions-{slug}.md`) frontmatter and taking `related_phases[0]`.
- `scope_prose`: string — a compact representation of the current scope used for semantic relevance scoring. **Not** required to equal the final `## Scope` section of `context.md`. In phase mode the caller supplies the slice's `covers_capabilities` bullets joined into a single paragraph (bullet markers replaced by `"; "`), falling back to phase bullets from `project-plan.md` when `covers_capabilities` is omitted. In task mode the caller supplies the user's inline prose (or `scope_description` from the task's own decisions doc if one already exists).

If any input is missing or malformed, abort with: `"decisions-correlator requires mode (phase|task), identifier, and scope_prose."`

If `mode` is not one of `phase` / `task`, abort with: `"decisions-correlator: mode must be 'phase' or 'task'."`

**Legacy integer-arg guard (phase mode):** if the caller passes an integer `NN` as identifier (legacy path) AND ≥2 phase-scope docs match NN, abort with the canonical message defined in `plan-pipeline/SKILL.md`: `"Phase NN has multiple slices: <list>. Pass an explicit slice slug."`. Integer shortcut continues to work when 0 or 1 phase-scope doc matches NN (monolithic semantics preserved).

## Procedure

1. **Glob candidates.** `Glob docs/decisions/*.md` → list of paths.

   **Phase mode — derive NN from slug.** Before filtering, bounded-`Read` the frontmatter of `docs/decisions/technical-decisions-{slug}.md` and extract `related_phases[0]` as the integer `NN`. If the slice's own doc is missing or malformed, abort with: `"decisions-correlator: cannot derive NN from slice slug '{slug}' — phase-scope doc missing or has no related_phases."`. `NN` is used only for output labeling and legacy-guard context; it is NOT used to filter the candidate pool (see step 3).

2. **Frontmatter-first filter.** For each candidate:
   - Locate the frontmatter fence: `Grep -n '^---$' <file>` → first two matches. Bounded `Read` of the top block (typically ≤15 lines).
   - Parse fields: `scope_type`, `related_phases`, `status`, `scope_description`.
   - Apply the mode-specific candidate-pool filter (see below).

3. **Candidate pool by mode.**
   - **phase mode (identifier = NN):** keep files where `scope_type: ad-hoc` AND `related_phases: []`. Rationale: these are the "origin 3" docs (tasks and standalone research) that are invisible to `decisions-reader` (which filters for `NN ∈ related_phases`). Docs with `NN ∈ related_phases` are already consumed by `decisions-reader`; docs with `related_phases: [MM]` (MM ≠ NN) or `scope_type: phase` for another phase do not belong to NN.
   - **task mode (identifier = {slug}):** keep every candidate EXCEPT `docs/decisions/technical-decisions-{slug}.md` (the task's own doc, if it exists). Every other decisions doc — phase-scope, ad-hoc with `related_phases: []`, ad-hoc with `related_phases: [NN...]` — is a potential correlation because the task has no phase relationship to pre-filter by.

4. **Semantic relevance per candidate.** For each file passing the pool filter:
   - Use `scope_description` (from frontmatter) as the primary signal. If `scope_description` is missing, derive a fallback from the filename slug (`technical-decisions-{slug}.md` → the slug prose reversed into spaces) and note the degraded confidence.
   - Score relevance against `scope_prose` at three levels: **high** (direct overlap: the decisions doc governs something the scope needs to respect — infra, shared primitives, data model), **medium** (adjacent: topic area touches but is not load-bearing), **low** (no obvious relation).
   - Produce one sentence of rationale per candidate explaining the score. Be honest: a clear "low — no intersection" is more useful than a stretched connection.

5. **Empty-pool short-circuit.** If the filter produced zero candidates, emit the empty-result shape (see Output contract) and return. Do not invent candidates.

6. **Emit output.** See Output contract.

## Output contract

Return **only** the structure below. No preamble, no closing summary.

### Non-empty case

Output label depends on mode:
- **Phase mode:** `## Correlated for Phase NN / slice {slug}` (NN derived in step 1).
- **Task mode:** `## Correlated Decisions for task {slug}`.

```
## Correlated for Phase NN / slice {slug}

| File | Slug | Score | Rationale |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| technical-decisions-base-setup.md | base-setup | high | TypeORM setup decides DB connection model that parallel tests must respect |
| technical-decisions-http-error-format.md | http-error-format | low | Error shape unrelated to test infrastructure |

### Ranked candidates

- **base-setup** (high): TypeORM setup decides DB connection model that parallel tests must respect
- **http-error-format** (low): Error shape unrelated to test infrastructure
```

Rules for the output:

- **Slug** — filename minus `technical-decisions-` prefix and `.md` suffix.
- **Score** — exactly one of `high` | `medium` | `low`.
- **Rationale** — a single sentence; no semicolons chaining multiple reasons; ≤160 chars per row.
- **Ordering** — rows sorted by score (high → medium → low); within a tier, alphabetical by slug.
- **Table AND ranked list are both emitted.** The caller uses the table for display and the ranked list for `AskUserQuestion` defaults.

### Empty case (no candidates in pool)

```
## Correlated for Phase NN / slice {slug}

_No candidates in pool._
```

(Task mode uses `## Correlated Decisions for task {slug}` as the header in the empty case.)

The caller short-circuits the AskUserQuestion step on this output (per `plan-context/SKILL.md` — "Confirm correlated decisions").

## Hard rules

- **No `## Filter Trace` block (intentional asymmetry with `decisions-reader` / `decisions-detail-reader`).** Those readers emit a Filter Trace as proof-of-iteration because their output is consumed downstream by structural transformations (context.md `## Decisions Index` rewrite, library target-set computation) where silent under-iteration would corrupt artifacts undetectably. The correlator's output is a ranked shortlist surfaced to the user via `AskUserQuestion` in plan-context Step 4 — silent under-iteration is naturally caught by user noticing a missing candidate in the confirmation dialog. The user-confirmation step IS the falsifiability mechanism here.
- **Never read TD bodies.** Only the frontmatter is consulted. If `scope_description` is missing, fall back to the filename slug; do not crack open the body to synthesize a description.
- **Never invent relevance.** A tenuous connection is `low` with an honest rationale. The caller decides inclusion; the subagent never pads the shortlist to look productive.
- **Never include the task's own decisions doc in task-mode output.** Filtering is by exact filename match (`technical-decisions-{slug}.md`).
- **Never include docs already consumed by `decisions-reader` in phase-mode output.** The pool is strictly the "origin 3" bucket — `scope_type: ad-hoc` AND `related_phases: []`.
- No prose preamble, no closing summary, no "Done.".
